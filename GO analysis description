##################GO 分析结果的描述 ############################
Biological function analysis of stromal cells was also performed by using GO of DEGs (Fig. S4C). For example, GO terms specific to zebrafish stromal cells included
‘‘RNA catabolic process’’ and ‘‘translation initiation.’’ GO terms including ‘‘glycerolipid biosynthetic process’’ and ‘‘immune response’’ were enriched for
mammalian stromal cells. Together, these findings may help to explain stronger regenerative potentials in the adult zebrafish tissues when compared to higher
organisms
