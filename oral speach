Our data provide an opportunity to understand treatment-associated genomic changes between pre- and postCRT specimens directly in patients.

with aid of
T cell differentiation seems to largely contribute to variation in the first dimension (UMAP1)
Cells expressing high levels of IRF8 and MPO were clearly distinct from the main thymocyte population that expressed CD7 and therefore most likely represent non-T-lineage cells
robustness
consistency
We also identified cells with intermediate expression of IRF8 and MPO, corresponding to immature T cell precursors 
coincided with
encodes for CD10
Cell clusters were annotated on the basis of the expression of selected marker genes from literature
This was further supported by hierarchical clustering, which confirmed that similar cell types cluster more closely together
putative
hematopoietic
Expression of these genes gradually decreased as T cell lineage specification and commitment progressed
pediatric
comprehensive
repertoire
we applied scRNA-seq to generate a comprehensive transcriptomic profile of the diverse cell populations present in embryonic,
fetal, pediatric, and adult stages of the human thymus, and we combined this with detailed TCR repertoire analysis to reconstruct the T cell differentiation process.
