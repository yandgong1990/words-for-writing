when it possesses the classic vertebrate bauplan. C1, C3, C7, C9 and C13 represented neuro-related cell types that highly expressed neurog1 and snap25a.
Epithelial-associated cells corresponded to C5, C6, C8, C12, C14 and C20 with high level of epcam and krt18. C11 and C22 were muscle cells expressing myl1 and mylpfa.
C26 was identified as mesoderm cells that expressed etv2 and lmo2.
######################################### gene expression with biology function #################################
Extracellular matrix genes, such as col1a1a and col1a2, showed significantly enhanced expression, indicating that stromal cells mainly participated in blastema formation.
Besides, blastema were enriched in cells expressing c1qtnf5, ecrg4a, and1, clu, and fgfbp2a, with confirmation of their localization by in situ hybridization (Fig. 5E and 5F,
Fig. S5A and S5B). The genes of c1qtnf5 and ecrg4a only expressed in outgrowth blastema involved in regulation of cell proliferation, which also highly expressed in
mantle cells corresponding to regeneration of hair cells in zebrafish
